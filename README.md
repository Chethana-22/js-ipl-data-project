## IPL Data Project I

This project involves downloading raw data from Kaggle, specifically "deliveries.csv" and "matches.csv" related to the Indian Premier League (IPL). The goal is to transform this data to generate a variety of statistics and insights for different IPL seasons. These statistics include the number of matches played per year, the number of matches won by each team per year, extra runs conceded by teams in 2016, identifying the top 10 economical bowlers in 2015, and more. To accomplish these tasks, the project implements separate functions for each analysis, and the results are stored as JSON files in the output folder. This project effectively leverages data analysis and manipulation to extract valuable insights from the IPL dataset.
